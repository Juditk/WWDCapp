			<string>The Digital Learning Room is an aid project with Rotary to deploy iPads and supporting technological infrastructure to two high schools in rural Fiji. My role was to configure the iPads and server, source apps relevant to the local curriculum and culture, and to devise a training plan.
                
On the ground, I worked with the schools on the island of Taveuni to support the roll out, the training of teachers, and the introduction of the devices to students. An ongoing relationship is maintained for support purposes to ensure the ongoing success of the project.
                
Rotary are currently working on securing funding for an additional 35 iPads per school with a target roll out date of July.</string>
