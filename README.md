WWDCapp
=======
Hello,

My name is Judit Klein and live in New Zealand. iOS development has been a big part of my university degree and my postgraduate research and this app was created as an application for a student scholarship for Apple's World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) in 2014. My entry was successful and I was awarded the scholarship.

This app has been targeted for iOS 7.1 and iPhone 5 and 5S. For best experience and to take advantage of all the features, run on device with the sound on. At any time, connect to a secondary display to enjoy additional content.

Enjoy! I apologize for the terrible programming jokes. 

If you have any questions or comments, you can email or Tweet me:
